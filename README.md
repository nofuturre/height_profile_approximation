# height_profile_approximation
The aim of the project is to implement Lagrange's interpolation.

Lagrange interpolation is primarily characterized by the simplicity of implementation and low memory complexity. 
It does not require solving a system of equations. Despite its stability, it is exposed to the so-called Runge's effect 
(the appearance of oscillations at the edges of the interval).
